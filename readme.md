Background
----------
A tavunu is an imaginary Earth-dwelling being that looks a bit like a [Patagonian Mara](https://www.worldlandtrust.org/species/mammals/patagonian-mara-hare/) and lives in a non-gendered but hierarchical society. Most interactions among tavunu are negotiated with pava --- items of status used for bargaining. Pava is always traded whole; you can't trade half a pava.
